# annotation_tool
This is an annotation tool for the Finding Interrogativity project.
The goal of this project: examine parents' speech to children to see if there is any cue for interrogtativity.
The tool helps coders to easily code one utterance at a time. 
Currently: need to put the script in the same folder as the input .csv file.
