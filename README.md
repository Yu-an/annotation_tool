# annotation_tool
This is an annotation tool for the Finding Interrogativity project.
The goal of this project is to see if there is any cue in parents' speech to children that would help them learn the link between clause types and their conventionalized speech acts.

This annotation tool helps annotators to identify the context (-20, +2 utterances) and annotate each utterance individually. If a particular file has already been annotated, put the -annot.csv file in the same folder as the original file to check the annotations.

For the actual annotation, please refer to the [annotation schema](../schema.pdf).
