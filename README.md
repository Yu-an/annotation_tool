# annotation_tool
This is an annotation tool for the Finding Interrogativity project.
The goal of this project: examine parents' speech to children to see if there is any differences between parents' use of declaratives and interrogatives.

This annotation tool helps annotators to identify the context (-20, +2 utterances) and annotate each utterance individually. If a particular file has already been annotated, put the -annot.csv file in the same folder as the original file to check the annotations.
