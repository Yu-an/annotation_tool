## Annotation Schema
### Pragmatic features
1. Utterance Goals: goals that are associated with an utterance that are recoverable by the interpreter from the discourse context, but are not the ones that are conventionally associated with a specific type of speech act 

-   **Drawing attention**: the current utterance directs the hearer’s attention
---
*Examples*
(1) Alex’s mother: Alex, Look!
(2) Alex’s mother: Where’s the tree?
Counterexample:
(3) Alex’s mother: (both looking at a rake with a big bird on it) is that big bird?     Teaching
[comment: the hearer’s attention is already on big bird, so doesn’t count as drawing attention]
---

-   **Negotiation**: the current utterance directs/permits the hearer (not) to carry out some action, commits the speaker (not) to carry out some action, or questions the possible moves to carry out next
---
*Examples*
(4) Alex’s Mother: (Alex moves around the swing) Don’t jump!
(5) Alex’s mother: you wanna ride?
(6) Alex’s mother: (commenting on flying a kite) there's not enough wind honey.
Counterexample:
(7) Alex’s Mother: (while assembling a kite) just put the string in.            Teaching 
[comment: She is teaching the hearer how to assemble a kite and not to negotiate for some actions to happen; not all directives are negotiations]
---

-   **Discussion**: consists of the exchange of information on various topics, including providing information/opinion or seeking information/opinion on some objects or events
---
*Examples*
(8) Alex’s Mother: (seeing the ropes for the swing are twisted) What happened?
(9) Alex’s Mother: that's uncle xxx and he does everything .    
(10)    Alex’s Mother: (adjusting Alex’s backpack) How’s that?
*Counterexample*
(11)    Alex’s mother: (commenting on flying a kite) there's not enough wind honey. Negotiation
[comment: the speaker is stating a fact, which counts as exchanging information, but the context is implied that she is indirectly rejecting the hearer’s request to fly a kite]
---

-   **Teaching (information/action)**: The goal of the current utterance is to expand the hearer’s knowledge on some objects or events, including sharing knowledge of some objects or events, testing the hearer’s knowledge, or instructing the hearer to perform certain actions 
---
*Examples*
(12)    Lily’s Mother: What’s that (pointing to a bumblebee)?
(13)    Lily’s Mother: It’s a bumblebee!
(14)    Alex’s Mother: (teaching Alex how to use a rake) You have to go forward.
(15)    i. Alex’s Mother: (both looking at cartoon characters on a kite) Where’s Elmo?
ii. Alex’s Mother: Show me.
[comment: requests can serve the goal of testing the hearer’s knowledge too] 
*Counterexamples*
(16)    Alex’s Mother: (seeing a bird flying by) Where’s the birdie?        Drawing attention
---

-   **Verbal Routines**: conventional verbal moves in games and social exchanges:
---
*Example*
(17)    Alex’s Mother: Ready? Go!
(18)    Lily’s Mother: Thank you!
---

-   **Emoting**: the goal of the current utterance is to express certain emotions
---
*Example*
(19)    Alex’s Mother: Wee!
(20)    Alex’s Mother: Good boy!
---

-  **Metacommunication**: the current utterance is contingent of another locutionary act, including demands for clarification, acknowledgment/confirmation of the meaning of hearer’s past utterances, or statements about previous utterances.
---
*Example*
(21)    Alex’s Mother: (after Alex makes some noise) What?
---

- **Immitation**: immitating sounds (onomatopoeia) or immitating the illocutor's utterance
---
*Example*
(22)    Alex’s Mother: vroom vroom
(23)    Alex's Mother: (imitating Alex's utterance) alei?
(24)    Alex's Mother: (while making the train flying around) wee!
---
-   **Uninterpretable**: uninterpretable vocalizations or verbalizations of which the communicative intent is unclear. Vocalizations include uninterpretable vocalizing or verbalizing.
