1. error message: tkinter doesn't have messagebox
(fixed: add "from tkinter import messagebox")
2. add context
3. simplified the buttons
4. layout: fixed position and window
5. selecting datafile is done by python input right now; need to think of a better way. Also input datafile is not going to be in the same directory as the script; need to fix this as well

1. the progress bar is wrong
2. the layout is still awful, buttons are too big! same category maybe have the same bg color??
3. fix the output format (hopefully in a better format)
4. the go-to function is gone now...
5. "previous" is gone
6. see if there is a way to read from the annotated file
