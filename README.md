# annotation_tool
This is an annotation tool for the Finding Interrogativity project.
The goal of this project: examine parents' speech to children to see if there is any cue for interrogtativity.
This annotation tool helps annotators to identify the context and annotate each utterance individually.  
Currently: read data from /data.
