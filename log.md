1. error message: tkinter doesn't have messagebox
(fixed: add "from tkinter import messagebox")
2. add context
3. simplified the buttons
4. layout: fixed position and window
5. selecting datafile is done by python input right now; need to think of a better way. Also input datafile is not going to be in the same directory as the script; need to fix this as well
